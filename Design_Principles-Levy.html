        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="complexity" class="borderRight">
        <h2>Complexity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Tesler's Law - Cannot reduce all complexity. </li>
            <li> Make important information visually salient.</li>
            <li> Provide fluid pathways. </li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="culture" class="borderLeft">
        <h2>Cultural Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Use colors and signs carefully, they mean different things to different cultures. </li>
            <li> Give your website many languages so that many different cultures can use it.</li>
            <li> Don't assume that the cultures are the same because they are close to each other.</li>
            <li> Know if the culture responds well to authority. </li>
            <li> Do user research to find out more about the culture! </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="conceptual" class="borderRight">
        <h2>Conceptual</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Design the model purposefully, don't let the technology determine the model. </li>
            <li> Make sure the designer's model, the user model, and the system image match! </li>
            <li> Be careful of the legacy issue, make sure to not keep going back to old designs if they are bad.</li>
            <li> Use metaphors to make the model simple. </li>
            <li> If you can't <em>easily</em> explain the model, it's bad! </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <li> Attention: Do NOT force people to focus for long times! People pay attention to salient clues. </li>
            <li> Perception: Use familiar designs, people scan things based on past experience. </li>
            <li> Learning: Make sure your product allows users to make mistakes when learning. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
